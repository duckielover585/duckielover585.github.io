        <h2>An Intro</h2>
        <p> Hello guys! On this website(webpage) I will make you relly want to go to space or research sapce. This is my first website so don't blame me if it isn't as good as you expected it. (Please ignore the phrase "DOCTYPE html". The coding wasn't working.) Well, I will include <strong>pictures and jucy facts. Please read until the end!</strong></p>
        <div id="info"><h2>A litte bit about space</h2>
        <p> Okay, so first of all, I will put in a nice little description of space. Space is an amazing place and one of the only places humans have not yet discovered fully. People have put satellites into orbits of many different planets. </p>
        <p>We have a good understanding of our solar system, but scientists need more. Still, many scientists and companies such as <em>NASA</em> and <em>SpaceX</em> are working on this. So far people think that <strong>the solar system keeps growing and is  <em>infinte</em>.</strong> </p>
        <h2>The Andromeda Galaxy</h2>
        There is another galaxy very close to us, 2.537 million light years away, and it is like a next-door neighbor to us. This galaxy is, as the name suggests, the Andromeda Galaxy. Scientists have already sent satalites to this galaxy. There are <strong>603</strong> habitable planets in this galaxy
