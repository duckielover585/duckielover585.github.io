   <div id="everything"><h1>Info About Space</h1>
        <h2>An Intro</h2>
            <p> Hello guys! On this website(webpage) I will make you really want to go to space or research sapce. This is my first website so don't blame me if it isn't as good as you expected it. Well, I will include <strong>pictures and juicy facts. Please read until the end!</strong></p>
        <div id="info"><h2>A litte bit about space</h2>
            <p> Okay, so first of all, I will put in a nice little description of space. Space is an amazing place and one of the only places humans have not yet discovered fully. People have put satellites into orbits of many different planets. </p>
            <p>We have a good understanding of our solar system, but scientists need more. Still, many scientists and companies such as <em>NASA</em> and <em>SpaceX</em> are working on this. So far people think that <strong>the solar system keeps growing and is  <em>infinte</em>.</strong> </p>
        <h2>The Andromeda Galaxy</h2>
            <p>There is another galaxy very close to us, 2.537 million light years away, and it is like a next-door neighbor to us. This galaxy is, as the name suggests, the Andromeda Galaxy. Scientists have already sent satalites to this galaxy. There are <strong>603</strong> habitable planets in this galaxy</p>
        <h2>The Milky Way</h2>
            <p>I am sorry for not starting with the Milky Way. I guess everyone knows about it, so I'll just start with how many planets we have. We have 8 planets. Mercuy, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranas, and Pluto. Well, I'm just gonna countinue with cool facts.
            Firstly, it has an invisible halo. There is a super-massive black hole in the center of the Milky Way. The Milky Way was made from other galaxies and still consumes them, so ltes stop talking about it before it consumes <strong><em>US!</em></strong></p>
        <h2>How Stars are Born</h2>
            <p>Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep within these clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under its own gravitational attraction. This was a small clip from Nasa.
